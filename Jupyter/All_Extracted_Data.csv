"Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6, CPU with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket, Micro ATX",No title,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),"Jan, 2024",TechfanUK,5.0,https://www.amazon.in/Intel-Generation-Desktop-Processor-Warranty/product-reviews/B09MDFH5HY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star

"Intel Core I5 12400F 12 Gen Generation Desktop Pc Processor 6, CPU with 18Mb Cache and Up to 4.40 Ghz Clock Speed Ddr5 and Ddr4 Ram Support Lga 1700 Socket, Micro ATX",No title,"INTROCome ÃÂÃÂ¨ giusto che sia, anzichÃÂÃÂ© comprare portatilini e preassemblati, un vero nerd si costruisce il computer da solo, e oltre a questo, condivide la sua esperienza nell'antica arte del PC Building anche con amici e parenti. Mio fratello aveva necessitÃÂÃÂ  di utilizzare un computer, e immaginando la tristezza di vederlo con un portatile, un preassemblato o ancora peggio con un Mac, ho pensato di costruirgli un computerino su misura. E comunque, quale modo migliore di convertire qualcuno al PC Gaming se non con un computer assemblato con tanto amore fraterno?Ho deciso quindi di scegliere questo processore perchÃÂÃÂ© trattandosi di una build sostanzialmente da utilizzo scolastico + gaming, e con un budget relativamente limitato (ok l'amore fraterno e tutto ma non esageriamo), mi sembrava il miglior compromesso tra prestazioni e qualitÃÂÃÂ . Alla fine il venditore mi ha spedito il 12400F, ma io volevo il 12400, quindi ho fatto il reso, e ho comprato il 12500 che comunque ÃÂÃÂ¨ identico a parte la GPU integrata e frequenze un pelino piÃÂÃÂ¹ alte, quindi lo posso recensire lo stesso visto che sostanzialmente sono lo stesso processore.Si tratta di un processore da 6 core e 12 thread, che non ha i fantomatici E-cores delle serie piÃÂÃÂ¹ costose (per sempio, il 12600 ha 6P-Core come questo piÃÂÃÂ¹ 4E-Core che aiutano nelle operazioni in background, specialmente se usate Windows 11), a una frequenza di 2.5 Ghz con un boost fino a 4.4Ghz se le temperature, il workload, e la vostra scheda madre lo permettono.Un processore di questo tipo eccelle nel gaming, ma non fa schifo neanche nelle operazioni piÃÂÃÂ¹ complicate, infatti questo processore si comporta benissimo anche nel video editing con Adobe Premiere.L'ho abbinato a una RTX3060 12G della Gigabyte e a 32Gb di DDR4 a 3200Mhz, il tutto su una Asus B660M-A Prime.PERFORMANCE E TEMPERATURECome dicevo prima, si tratta di un processore di fascia media particolarmente portato per il gaming, ma che gestisce senza intoppi anche le operazioni piÃÂÃÂ¹ ""professionali"". L'architettura di questi processori Intel di dodicesima generazione, dopo un'undicesima generazione abbastanza deludente, ÃÂÃÂ¨ eccellente.Senza dare i numeri con benchmark e altre cose poco comprensibili, vi posso dire che nel gaming si comporta allo stesso livello del buon vecchio Ryzen 5 5600X, senza dubbio il miglior processore di fascia media assieme a questo. Non credo avrete problemi in gaming o produttivitÃÂÃÂ  utilizzando questo processore, ammesso che il resto dell'hardware sia all'altezza.Io lo utilizzo con delle banali DDR4 a 3200Mhz, quindi come performance siamo simili al 5600X che avevo su una mia build dell'anno scorso, se invece lo abbinate a delle DDR5 un po' serie puÃÂÃÂ² sicuramente superarlo anche se di poco.In ogni caso, nel gaming si comporta benissimo, specialmente se abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria (come la mia RTX3060). Non ho notato colli di bottiglia, specialmente nel caso di questa build, che sarÃÂÃÂ  usata con un monitor ""solo"" 1080p.Per quanto riguarda le temperature, si tratta di una CPU abbastanza tranquilla con un TDP di solo 65W. Al momento non ho un dissipatore, perchÃÂÃÂ© non mi ÃÂÃÂ¨ arrivato, quindi sto usando il dissipatore stock incluso nella confezione. Mi aspettavo facesse pena, invece ÃÂÃÂ¨ decisamente accettabile. Le temperature non superano i 70C in gaming, anche con giochi pesanti, mentre invece sfruttandola al massimo con un Cinebench, non supera gli 80C, che ÃÂÃÂ¨ accettabile e ampiamente sotto la soglia di throttling di 100C. Anche il rumore della ventolina originale ÃÂÃÂ¨ abbastanza contenuto, quindi boh, magari lo tengo con il dissipatore stock. Sicuramente comunque il mio case, un NZXT con 4 ventole aggiuntive, aiuta non poco, oltre a questo non mi fidavo del velo di pasta termica preapplicata, e ci ho messo la mia fidata Gelid GC Extreme, perchÃÂÃÂ© per un processore da 65W con il dissi stock sicuramente ÃÂÃÂ¨ necessaria una pasta termica di livello Extreme.VERSIONE F O NON F? TRAY O BOX? GPU INTEGRATA?La differenza tra le due versioni sta nella disponibilitÃÂÃÂ  della GPU integrata. La versione F non la include, e generalmente costa un po' meno. A seconda della differenza di prezzo, valutate se prendere una o l'altra. Io non sono un fan delle GPU integrate Intel e cerco sempre quando possibile di abbinare una GPU dedicata, anche se scarsissima. In questo caso ho la RTX3060 che ÃÂÃÂ¨ una buona scheda da gaming, quindi perchÃÂÃÂ© ho voluto prendere il processore con la GPU integrata? PerchÃÂÃÂ© con certi programmi che supportano la tecnologia Intel Quicksync, la GPU integrata non sta lÃÂÃÂ¬ a dormire ma viene utilizzata attivamente per l'encoding video o per altre operazioni, come per esempio la timeline in Premiere. Il fratellino utilizza Adobe Premiere che puÃÂÃÂ² sfruttare questa tecnologia, ma anche altri programmi di video editing o streaming la usano, come per esempio OBS Studio, che puÃÂÃÂ² sfruttare l'encoder video della GPU integrata per strimmare, lasciando libera la GPU dedicata per il gioco.In ogni caso, la GPU Integrata ÃÂÃÂ¨ la solita Intel UHD, sul 12400 ÃÂÃÂ¨ la UHD 730, sul 12500 la 770. Non l'ho testata molto nel gaming, ma comunque non aspettatevi chissÃÂÃÂ  cosa. La potenza di questa ÃÂÃÂ¨ simile alle entry level dedicate sui portatili di qualche anno fa come la 930M o giÃÂÃÂ¹ di lÃÂÃÂ¬, quindi va bene per giochi leggeri. In ogni caso, non ha problemi di sorta quando si tratta di visualizzare video o immagini 3D non particolarmente complesse, regge senza problemi i video in 4k su youtube o giochini retro ed emulatori vari.Per quanto riguarda altre nomenclature criptiche, a volte vediamo Tray o Box, la differenza tra le due ÃÂÃÂ¨ la presenza del dissipatore nella versione Box. Come dicevo sopra, il dissipatore ÃÂÃÂ¨ scarso ma per una CPU come questa ÃÂÃÂ¨ sufficiente. Se invece il dissi non vi serve, prendete la versione Tray.PRENDO IL 12400, 12500 O 12600?Secondo me, tra questi tre il migliore ÃÂÃÂ¨ il 12400 e vi spiego anche il perchÃÂÃÂ©.Il 12400 e il 12500 sono fratelli, mentre il 12600 ÃÂÃÂ¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore.Partiamo dal 12500, questo processore ha la stessa base del 12400 ma con frequenze di base e di boost poco piÃÂÃÂ¹ alte, oltre che una gpu integrata leggermente piÃÂÃÂ¹ potente (ovvero la Intel UHD 770 contro la 730 del 12400). Le frequenze piÃÂÃÂ¹ alte in buona sostanza si traducono in un miglioramento statico in media del 5%, di piÃÂÃÂ¹ o di meno a seconda del workload, ma praticamente mai sopra il 10%. La GPU integrata ÃÂÃÂ¨ di poco piÃÂÃÂ¹ potente, ma si tratta sempre di un'integrata scarsissima poco adatta per il gaming a prescindere. Se la differenza di prezzo fosse di una decina di euro ci potrebbe anche stare, ma onestamente non mi viene in mente nessuna ragione per la quale il 12500 merita di esistere a quasi 100ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬ in piÃÂÃÂ¹. Evitatelo. Io l'ho comprato solo perchÃÂÃÂ© mi serviva di fretta e il venditore ha sbagliato a inviarmi il 12400F anzichÃÂÃÂ© il 12400. Altrimenti non l'avrei mai comprato.Il 12600 invece ÃÂÃÂ¨ su un altro campo da gioco, ed ÃÂÃÂ¨ a tutti gli effetti il modello superiore. Come dicevo all'inizio, oltre ai 6 P-Core il 12600 ha 4 E-Core, oltre che frequenze piÃÂÃÂ¹ alte, e la versione K se volete overcloccare. Per il prezzo di quasi 150ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬ sopra al 12400, potrebbe anche starci se rientra nel vostro budget e fate multitasking intenso o molte operazioni di rendering. Nel gaming sono praticamente uguali, la differenza tra i due si percepisce a framerate elevati e risoluzioni basse, in giochi AAA magari in 4k sarete limitati dalla GPU nella maggior parte dei casi. In ogni caso, se si vuole assemblare un PC con un budget piÃÂÃÂ¹ alto del mio e magari abbinato ad una GPU piÃÂÃÂ¹ potente della mia 3060, potrebbe valerne la pena, anche solo per la presenza degli E-Cores.Comunque, ritengo che il 12400 sia lo sweet spot, da considerare per qualunque PC di fascia media, valutando eventualmente un upgrade tra qualche anno alla generazione 13xxx quando caleranno i prezzi.CONCLUSIONEChe dire, il 12400 ÃÂÃÂ¨ una CPU di tutto rispetto, ad un prezzo molto conveniente tra l'altro. ÃÂÃÂ eccellente in una build da gaming di fascia media, abbinato ad una GPU un po' seria, e non fatica nemmeno nei programmi di grafica professionali (utilizzati a livello amatoriale o scolastico).Sicuramente non vi sto dicendo niente di nuovo, ma lo consiglio appieno per build di fascia media e budget contenuto.","Mar, 2023",MRK,5.0,https://www.amazon.in/Intel-Generation-Desktop-Processor-Warranty/product-reviews/B09MDFH5HY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star

If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.","Apr, 2022",Divyansh singh Jadav,4.0,https://www.amazon.in/Intel-Generation-Desktop-Processor-Warranty/product-reviews/B09MDFH5HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=four_star

Anche se il clock di partenza ÃÂÃÂ¨ 2.5 GHz, sappiate che la scheda madre attiva il turbo boost e vi fa arrivare fino a 4.4GHz. Per quanto riguarda i consumi, in uso normale sta sotto i 60w (20-50w), nei giochi massimo mi ha registrato (poi dipende) un carico massimo di 90w. Sotto stress, 117w precisi, netti, come dichiarato da intel. Ora perÃÂÃÂ² passiamo al maledetto tasto dolente che perseguita da anni questi processori: il dissipatore. Io ho provato diversi dissipatori, e devo dire che si sono impegnati, anche se il sistema push-pin rimane macchinoso (non entra alla perfezione). Lo so, vi sembra strano, ma anche se non ÃÂÃÂ¨ perfettamente agganciato, copre ugualmente tutta la superficie dissipante, potete stare tranquilli. In-game, la massima temperatura che ho registrato (con temperatura ambiente di 35ÃÂÃÂ°C) ÃÂÃÂ¨ stata di 85ÃÂÃÂ°C. Poi quando avevo provato con temperatura ambiente di 25ÃÂÃÂ°C, la temperatura ÃÂÃÂ¨ scesa a 78ÃÂÃÂ°C! Sembrano valori alti, ma fidatevi che per un dissipatore stock fa il suo sporco lavoro.

Quindi aggiorno la recensione a 5 stelleAGGIORNAMENTO FERRAGOSTOÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¥Il dissipatore stock mi ha abbandonato, temperature schizzate a 100ÃÂÃÂ°C e poi va in protezione. A quanto pare deve essere montato perfettamente sennÃÂÃÂ² non ce la fa. Dunque lo sostituisco con un tower. Sconsiglio di usare quello stock se non volete incappare in questi spiacevoli inconvenienti. Aggiorno a 4, nella speranza di non avere ulteriori problemi.","Jul, 2023",Biagio s.,4.0,https://www.amazon.in/Intel-Generation-Desktop-Processor-Warranty/product-reviews/B09MDFH5HY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=four_star

You have to be very careful about which GPU is paired with this i3 to prevent noticeable bottlenecks. I tried a few combinations, given how touted this was as a such a good budget option, and while it always seemed to work decent in GPU intensive games, CPU intensive games always suffered and exhibited massive amounts of stuttering and fps drops, even if the resolution was raised to 1440p and settings favored GPU. For reference I was using higher end cards to test, such as an MSI Trio RX 6800 and an EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3, and yes, I was aware it would bottleneck to begin with, but was hoping it would not be as severe as it was to serve as a temporary fix until I could upgrade later in the year. Many reviewers also glowed about how it could be paired with more high-end GPUs, but this clearly isn't the case for some games. Fortnite is one example that suffered massively. I wouldn't recommend pairing this with anything more than an RX 6600, RTX 3060, or something slightly older such as a GTX 1660 TI.","Nov, 2022",Andy,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/i3-12100F-processor-featuring-support-required/product-reviews/B09NPJX7PV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1

Just not quality.I have been using a big screen TV for a monitor my for many years and never had this issue, so I don't think it's the TV.

I installed Windows 11, and it shows 20 cores. Benchmarking with RDR2 shows a laughable difference from an I7-6700K, which is a 7 year old processor; it was 2-3fps on average. It's all about the GPU folks, the CPU after 7 years makes just about 1% difference.All these fools overclocking and worrying about memory latency? OK, if you're running a database or video editing; for the other 99%, this is a great processor, but it won't make a dimes worth of difference in FPS. I didn't really believe it would, but was curious how much of a difference a new CPU (that is 7 years newer), a new motherboard, and new memory would make. It makes almost no difference. I only really replaced the hardware all because I was seriously worried it was going to fail and the newer GPU will need the newer PCIE 4.0 bus.

Intel Core i7-12700KF Gaming Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,"Works well, but.....E cores suck.....and it took me a year to find the fix :(","This review is on my Intel Core i7-12700F bought over a year ago.In a nutshell, -1 star for E cores.It now runs everything I want (once I made changes that took it from a 2 star to a 4 star) fast.  I suppose that based on the age it could be a 3 star, but I am rating it as when I started using it over a year ago.  I am using Win 10 still, but I doubt (based on my new laptop) if going to Win 11 would matter.I spent over a year with some software running much slower than on my I7-8700 and my browsers would take over a minute to start working.  When I got my new I9 Win 11 laptop I found I had many of the same issues but it had software that allowed me to easily play with the problem.  Much research later and some playing around I have discovered that the E cores were the cause of my issues.  I tried several combinations with this processor but the only combination that works as expected is when *ALL* E cores are turned OFF in BIOS.Now I know that the 'powers that be' seem to claim we are causing issues by dumping the E cores, but I can not see anything but improvement by doing so (Win 10).  It may be that I am a simplistic user with gaming, simple word processing and spreadsheets, surfing and research, and Folding @ Home and do not compute in the areas that MIGHT be affected by this modification.I am now happy with this processor and wish I knew a year ago what I recently found out and implemented.  Now I blow the doors off of my old I7-8700 in all that I do.  I told several friends about this and so far I have not heard of any negatives from dumping the E cores.","Oct, 2023",Ray,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-12700KF-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FXKHN7M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=2

Under load yes they do draw more power than their AMD counterparts however at idle (which is what most peoples pcs are doing most of the time) they draw less than their AMD counterparts. Unless you're driving this thing full tilt all the time, it is very power efficient. Gaming performance is great and the few titles that are not working now (early adopter bugs, AMD has had more than their fair share over the years) trust me they'll be ironed out.

FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN MAY 2023, I can't tell if it's the motherboard firmware, Windows 10/11 scheduler (I did try both OSs), Intel's drivers, or even Plex not updated yet - what/whoever fault it is doesn't matter. I kept seeing my system crash constantly, the E CORES being used for EVERYTHING Plex needs (including transcoding) and overall, I am not convinced Intel's P+E Cores aren't ready for prime time.I ended up refunding this processor in order to get an Intel Core i9-10900K for the extra cores. I WOULD'VE gone with AMD if it wasn't for ensuring the best compatibility with Intel ARC because I want AV1 encoding capabilities.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Impressive,"Decided to finally upgrade from my 6 or 7 year old Asus X99 platform and 980ti sli (yes that old) to an Asus Tuf Z790/12600k/Tuf 4080 OC gamers edition. My old 5820k was creating a HUGE bottleneck issue for my GPU, which I installed about a month prior. What a difference I must say. Now that I'm finally out of the stone age, I'm in awe as to how much things have changed in the PC gaming world. This current build smokes everything I throw at it so far. Which admittedly has only been a few games and benchmarks. I paired the processor and GPU with water blocks from an AIO Corsair system for my CPU, and a separate Granzon custom loop for the GPU. All I can say is wow. Fast boot times, 150 plus fps in some games like The Division 2 with medium settings at 1440p. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this processor/Z790 motherboard/GPU combo. Are there better options for better performance or there? Absolutely. But for the money, I believe that the average gamer would be hard pressed to find any significant issues with that platform. I was skeptical at first, as this is the first I5 processor I ever purchased for a PC, but as I stated previously, I am quite satisfied with my decision to take a leap of faith. Again, I highly recommend this processor. Can't beat the performance at this price point with a stick.","Nov, 2023",Sho'Nuff,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-12600K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FX4D72T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,"Good chip, runs cool, still improving","I recently built an 15 12600k system and it has plenty of ups and downs. I don't see any of the downs being the fault of the chip or Intel. Most of the issues I have experienced with the new system (and there have been many), have to do with the motherboard or ddr5. I upgraded from a i7 4770k I had on a 24/7 4.8ghz overclock for 7 years. The new I5 is CLEARLY faster in both single and multi threaded performance. Like many I experience many errors in the windows 11 event viewer usually something to do with an efficiency core. At the end of the day I don't see any real world effects on performance, and even microsoft says to ignore these errors.I have traditionally chosen intel because of their on board graphics support. I've had a graphics card go out in the past and having on board video allows you to at least use your system as a system while you figure out what has happened. If amd ever decides to see the value in having on board video from an administrator perspective; I may have to reconsider them.I am happy with the upgrade to the new chip and support for the new technology will only get better.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,The best value CPU of this generation,"IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm so glad I decided to step up from the 12600T I was planning on using to the 12600K, which is the cheapest Intel CPU that has the efficiency cores. I was nervous at first, because my plan was to build a low-ish power, 100% passively-cooled, internal GPU, no moving parts PC for use in my bedroom, where my previous computers were annoyingly loud. I used a Noctua NH-P1 passive cooler and a Seasonic PX-500 fanless PSU, and my system is not only 100% silent, it turns in impressive benchmark numbers and never gets close to throttling temperatures even after sustained Cinebench runs.I run my system at -130 mV, with no overclocking, and CPU power consumption peaks at about 100 W, while idle CPU power consumption is less than 2W. My heatsink never gets too hot to touch with my bare hand in daily use. The only thing preventing my system from being a high performance gaming PC is the lack of dedicated GPU, but the internal GPU is more than enough for me to run four simultaneous instances of BlueStacks 5 to play my favorite mobile game, and fast enough to run Diablo III and EVE Online with medium settings.The Core i5-12600K is roughly competitive in performance and price with the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X.","Aug, 2022",Midori Aoi,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-12600K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FX4D72T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_6?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=6
Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Amazing CPU for the money!,Just got it for my NZXT gaming PC custom build & seems to work great. Install was easy & doesn't have the annoying fragile socket pins older CPUs used to have. You just place it on the socket close the bracket install your cooler & it should be good to go. I seem to have very good frame rate stability & seems to be able to handle most games even without a GPU. If a game used to be on console it'll likely work with this CPU & perform better than gaming console CPUs. I used to use a basic mini PC with an older i7 6700T but with this in my gaming PC is have next to no issue running HD graphics in games like GTA 5. And its amazing for the price. Was going to go with an i7 13700K this ended up costing half the price of the i7 & an i7 may be a bit overkill for most of the games I plan on playing on my PC anyway.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Don't trust UserBenchmark,"UserBenchmark favors intel for some reason.  They would have you believe the 12600k is around 20% better than the 5600x, but watch CPU reviews on Youtube and you'll see individual gaming benchmarks puts them at the same performance but with the 5600x using half the power consumption.  Additionally, the motherboards for the 12600k can cost over twice as much as that of the 5600x ones.It basically just makes more sense to go with the 5600x at the time of this review, because both CPUs are the same price of $300.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Do NOT run over 4800 DDR5! - Warranty will be voided!,"I purchased this processor and was happy with it until I stumbled upon a youtube video that proclaimed that most memory doesn't run at it's max speed. My DDR5 memory did just that - it ran at 4000 instead of it's 5200 (and it is certified to run on this processor). In my motherboard's BIOS, I adjusted the memory to run at 5200 with XMP-1 (an ASUS setting). It crashed a lot, so I tried their XMP-2 setting and everything froze up. Next thing I knew, nothing worked! I bought new memory, a new motherboard and eventually a new processor. When I found out this processor was the part that went bad (and it has a 3 year warranty), I submitted a ticket to Intel and they concluded that I ""overclocked"" the processor by pushing the memory to 5200 and they sent me to their webpage that specified this processor has a 4800 limit. Since then, I looked at every page before the one they sent me and none of them said anything about the 4800 memory speed limit.If setting memory speed a little over 4800 will fry your processor, shouldn't there be warnings everywhere and in every step of your tweaking? I now have a fried processor sitting on my desk and who is to blame? Is it me for trying to get the best performance out of my hardware and never seeing any warnings about this? Or maybe for Intel for their XMP standard that doesn't give you any warnings - especially since this is their standard that they created.I give this processor 2 stars - 5 for performance, but 0 for getting my fried processor and blaming me for ignorance of technicalities that are not upfront and lack of a warning system that they could have and should have implemented to prevent such catastrophes.","Aug, 2022",Joshua J.

Intel Core i5-12600K Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 10 (6P+4E) Cores up to 4.9 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Pain in to setup. Nothing but a headache. I wish I would have got a different cpu.,"No support for deepcool heatsinks, wasted time modifying it to fit, (it does work, but wasted a couple hours on a process that should take 5-10 minutes). I have never had so much trouble get a cpu to run in linux. Good grief, IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm a computer expert by trade, and intel should have waited to release this series. I know the competition is tough, but I definitely wont go and buy another one of these. I thought it would be a good investment. I may have damage my motherboard on install, as the cpu slip out of my hands and banged up against the socket bent some pins. It was so hard to get running under linux, graphics support is nonexistent, i can only the XE2 new graphics cards will be more of the same since these are based on that Technology. You can find a work around on Phoronix for the graphics problem, however the image on linux sucks itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs more pixelated than i would like. I would like to mention I needed to my rx 580 to get this thing running as the Linux OS didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt recognize the GFX chip on the cpu. And with the way the situation is with gpuÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm lucky to have had one at hand. The Bios also doesnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt show on my pc correctly if you use the onboard Intel graphics, its cutoff . Also the hard drive was not recognized with the motherboard but it happed two motherboard asrock and gigabyte. I had to install a new elilo version to get the efi to work. What can i say the performance is good, but runs hot 120 watts at the cpu when doing multithreaded task like compiling the kernel. It does that fast but Ryzen 12 core does it faster and with less power 95watts. ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs hard to say this was an upgrade, my head hurts whenever an issue comes up with this cpu. Now after about month of use the gfx is acting weird, it starts to fragment / pixelated and gets stuck. IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm sure intel knows and I probably should have just gotten a kf series instead because it is so bad now i just left the dang rx 580 in the system. Maybe IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm not the only one, IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm sure a class action lawsuit is in the works. I have not been able to enjoy this since I purchased on day one. I would have returned this but then I would have to return the motherboard to another vendor and i sure donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt want to go to that trouble. I fortunately got ddr4 version so I reduced the amount of ram in the computer and will use it as is until it dies. Hopefully after this crypto boom IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be able to snag a ryzen 5th gen combo for cheap. My intel can fix this but it will be years before this happens. They are too busy playing catch up. The power efficiency is terrible and the whole experience is about as bad as it gets. Save yourself a headache and get something comparable like a 3700x or better. This is not worth the price or painful install procedures. I just thought it was ridiculous coming from intel, didnt they create the PCs we know of today??? Did i mention the bios was cuttoff on left and right edges so you cant read the functions??? IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm surprised Intel engineers released this, more of a sample than a final product. Buy something else, did i mention the cheapest motherboard sets you back around $200, so $500 into this ordeal is not a good experience, could have purchased 2 sets of used ryzen 7 8 core cpus and motherboard for the same money and ultimately gotten more performance in power usage and cpu. ThatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs my thoughts on this product.","Jan, 2022",Brian,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-12600K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FX4D72T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1&reviewerType=all_reviews#reviews-filter-bar

I tried to swap RAM, BIOS flash, reset, tried to to plug out and in CPU pin connectors and etc. It just didn't worked, but it wasn't main problem, when I tried to pu my old cpu(12400) back to MB it didn't turned on also, sayÃÂÃÂ±n same problems.

Intel Core i9-12900K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Insanely Powerful at The Cost of High Thermal/Power,"My primary use case for the 12900k is gaming and encoding video. Personally I could justify the higher price tag over the competing i5 and i7 because of my specific use case.Good Things:The processor is absolutely and insanely powerful. I am encoding 1080, 30fps video roughly 50% to 80% faster give or take than my previous processor which was a 11700kf! One single generation and an i9 upgrade has saved me astronomical amounts of time. As far as gaming goesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ I would say is more heavily reliant on a graphics card so I wonÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt go into much detail on that. Overall this processor is wonderful and deserves its 5 stars.Not so good things:I didnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt take a star off for this because it isnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt really a problem rather just the way the processor is designed.It uses a metric ton of power, IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm talking 241 watts during my normal video encoding sessions. Which in turn generates a space heater worth of heat. One of those things ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂgreat power comes great responsibilityÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. I am telling you this because you NEED TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COOLER. I am currently using a Noctua NH-D15 and itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs okay. I would recommend it to anyone that prefers air cooling but nothing less. If you choose a cooler that is less you will regret it. I would venture to say you need the cooler I have mentioned or 280mm and above AIO to even keep it from thermal throttling at heavy load. Do not underestimates this, gaming it is much more tame, still running high temperatures but better. I still would get a really great CPU Cooler or otherwise you WILL be thermal throttling like crazy.Overall this is a great CPU and although not worth it for some, can be a great processor if it is worth it. Just beware of the watts and heat. I was dumbfounded.","Apr, 2022",Poolboy16,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FXDLX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1
Intel Core i9-12900K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Not necessary for everyone,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.","May, 2023",Chris H,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FXDLX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

Intel Core i9-12900K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Great Upgrade from 9900K,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.","Jan, 2023",2sofakinggreat,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FXDLX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i9-12900K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 16 (8P+8E) Cores up to 5.2 GHz Unlocked LGA1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k.

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.","Dec, 2021",Electrosoft,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-12900K-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/product-reviews/B09FXDLX95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1

"Intel Core i3 (12th Gen) i3-12100 Quad-core (4 Core) 3.30 GHz Processor - Retail Pack, Blue",This is the PERFECT processor/best value for basic productive work!,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).","May, 2022",Average Customer,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-i3-12100-Quad-core-Processor/product-reviews/B09NPHJLPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

It only has 4 cores but they are so fast that it can compete with other processors like the 5600G. The integrated graphics aren't amazing but they get the job done and have allowed me to run light games like Roblox and Civ VI while I save for a graphics card. The stock cooler is not amazing at cooling but the i3 12100 doesn't take much power so while any new cooler would probably be an improvement, this one has been doing just fine.

Idle temperature is about 40C and the processor peaks at about 65C under load. That being said, the fan is very audible at max speed (3,000 RPM) to maintain that stable temperature under load.

"Intel Core i3 (12th Gen) i3-12100 Quad-core (4 Core) 3.30 GHz Processor - Retail Pack, Blue",Does not have Iris Xe,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows. If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.","Sep, 2023",swmagicien,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Core-i3-12100-Quad-core-Processor/product-reviews/B09NPHJLPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i7-13700K Gaming Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Super Fast and temperatures aren't as bad as I expected,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads.","Mar, 2024",Robert Johnson,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF57FL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use.

Intel Core i7-13700K Gaming Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,For those who are on the fence about upgrading from 12th generation Intel,"Above are screenshots of my Passmark benchmark, both systems exactly the same, except the first picture has the 13700K and the second picture has the 12700K in it.

Vetroo Lurker 240mm AIO water cooling, Power color RX 6900 XT. I run all (P) cores synced at 5300 MHz. Temps idle at about 32 to 35C, hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 C once, typically about 75C. Ordinary gaming, tasking takes it to about 45 to 50C.If you are wondering if its worth the upgrade, it is. But considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components, I would have to say that upgrading to a Z790 motherboard is NOT worth it if you already have a Z690.That is all, and good day to you.","Dec, 2022",michael berring,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF57FL5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_5?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=5

Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2ÃÂÃÂ°-3ÃÂÃÂ° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k.

In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability.","Feb, 2023",A.

Intel Core i7-13700K Gaming Desktop Processor 16 cores (8 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,"Great CPU, but hard to cool","After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.","Jun, 2023",A Reader,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-13700K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF57FL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,The performance bargain of the century.,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.","Feb, 2023",YALE70,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600KF-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF5CZ16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,Coming from i5 12400f,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂm running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)","Apr, 2024",Amazon Customer,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600KF-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF5CZ16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

My wifes runs bone stock with a NZXT Kraken 280mm and stays idle at about 29c and around 55c when gaming. Mine on the other hand is on a Vetro 360 aio and is overclocked to 5.6ghz all core stable and can get quite warm. Reaching 80-88c at times. Running mine at stock speed drops it to about 55c during gaming as well. I got mine to a 5.7ghz stable but started hitting TJmax so i undervolted and clocked down to 5.6ghz and runs fine. I have a friend who went with the 13900k and hes only netting 10-12 more fps than my OCed 13600k.

Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,No title,"Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor.Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth.

Beyond making non booting systems easier to troubleshoot, it turns out that IntelÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs QuickSync encoder/decoders offer benefits that even the top range NVIDIA cards do not offer.  Apps like DiVinci or Adobe Premiere can utilize IntelÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs QuickSync in addition to NVIDIA transcoders, making the K cpu significantly faster in those use cases.Granted that in gaming cases the K and KF provide the same performance - but if you ever need the encoding options in the future, youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll miss them.The K series will retain the $30 premium later on the used market when the time comes, so why not invest in the most options you can right now?","Mar, 2023",Tom,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600KF-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF5CZ16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) - Unlocked,Honest review for 13600KF,"I have no idea why people are praising this CPU. It is a power hog, when I load something I literally see my computer slowing down for 13600k to power up. It is constantly thermal throttling to the point of blue screen of death, even though I am using it with 240 Thermaltake GlacierOne liquid cooler on a higher end Z790 board. 13600k is very unstable and absolutely requires 360 liquid cooler to handle it, even at stock speed. Sure, I can limit it and it will not affect gaming or I can turn off E-cores, but what is the point of spending so much more money then? I had an excellent experience with 12400F, no stability issues, perfect temperatures all the time. I may go back to 12400F or get 13400F, I am definitely not keeping 13600kf.In order to get a full potential of 13600k you need RTX 4090. I have a brand new RTX 4080 and it is used at 100% while playing Cyberpunk 2077, CPU was showing only at 70%. Save money and get 13400F instead or wait until 14th gen comes out later this year.","Jan, 2023",Nick,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13600KF-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF5CZ16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,"The best CPU I have ever had, and good price, too.  But beware of Z690 motherboards","I got this and a new DDR5 motherboard with Z690 chipset.  It didn't boot when I set it all up.  It turns out the Z690 needs a BIOS update to work with this CPU.  Luckily I had an older i7 that worked on this motherboard.  I dropped it in and it booted, then I did the BIOS update.  After that it boots this CPU just fine.Before this I was a die-hard AMD supporter.  I had 5950x with 16 cores, 32 threads, and 72MB of cache.  But, it just doesn't compete with this i9.  I haven't tried the 7950x, but I read that the P-cores just blow away the AMD cores.  Even with less cache.  The setup of 8 performance cores, and 16 efficiency cores just works.  It stays much cooler than earlier i9's and the AMD.  I use a water cooler, but it's not required.  Nothing slows this down when paired with DDR5.I wish the AMD was better, I like the company more.  But, I want the best of the best, and as of today there is nothing better than this available.  If you game, or do graphics, or anything on your PC this is the CPU for you.  It will NOT disappoint.A word on the X790 chipset.  You would think they will have better performance because they are newer.  They don't.  They will work with the i9 no matter what, while the Z690 might need a BIOS update.  They have one more USB port.  But otherwise there is no benefit to getting Z790 and they cost a LOT more.  So, if you have the ability to use an older CPU to flash the bios, or find one that is new enough that it doesn't need the update, this CPU will be great.","Feb, 2023",Adam White,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=1

I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do.","Aug, 2023",Nikk,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2
Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Indescribably good,"ItÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs so good, and that makes sense since itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs top of the line right now (imagine that.)

If youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂre shopping for your build right now and considering this, if itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs in the budget and you want something thatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll handle literally whatever you want then yes, this is great. But just remember, whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for.Now that IÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve warned you about not needing this; let me just say how happy I am that I got it. I do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue, runs smoothly and efficiently (does get hot though) if youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂve got a good cooler on this then youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll be good to go for a long time.","May, 2023",Aerie,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Over clock at your risk,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C.","Feb, 2023",Pierre Aubert Espenan,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=2

It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100ÃÂÃÂ°C within 12 seconds of starting.

This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k.

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Revised this review. Sorry,"Intel this is a great product. It's fast, works great, and your memory support is better than amd. Now i just have one request. Please start reusing motherboard sockets longer. take a note from AM4.Original review ^^^ basically. I loved the cores what's the need for a revised review. CRASHING HEAT> It's real. After about a year of pretty light use but gaming it started to fail.I had to undervolt and dink around.note to intel/board manufactures we want margin by default, and that's what you need to advertise. i have to lower this becuase you are advertising performance that you really can't get. It's not a bad product but it's pushed about 10% more than it should. I would not have expected this from intel. It's not really boards i mean they should have reasonable defaults, but i get this issue even at 253w. I contacted intel and they were telling me to raise voltage more. I mean that's not good either it's even less efficient, and what happens in a year when  my warranty expires.Amd did this too for a while when they were behind with bulldozer. I know.  They were relatively small then.

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,"Amazing processor, but check your CPU power management in BIOS","So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.","May, 2024",Carlos Canales,3.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=three_star&pageNumber=1

Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80ÃÂÃÂ°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80ÃÂÃÂ°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth.

We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Will be dead on arrival or degrade over months,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases. Unacceptable for a company worth over $100B to push out a product like this.","Apr, 2024",Erik Gerlitz,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1
Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Worst warrenty support i have ever delt with or it doesnt support windows 10 or 11.,"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky.","Jul, 2023",Zev,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BCF54SR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star&pageNumber=1

Intel Core i9-13900K Desktop Processor 24 (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Do you feel lucky?,"This I9 chip is very likely guilty of destroying 2 ASUS ROG Maximus Hero Z790 motherboards.

Picture number 1 is the offending chip.  Picture number 2 is the socket of the first motherboard after it destroyed it (picture taken by ASUS service).  Picture number 3 is the socket of the replacement motherboard ASUS sold me cheap AFTER this I9 destroyed it (wife's picture).  Since it arrive 15 Sept, Amazon says they can't help me.  Intel is thinkimng about what they are going to do.  Bottom line:  I'm out $900 for motherboards and Amazon and ASUS have declined to help any more.  We'll see what Intel does.  I've spent ~15 hours dealing with this: setting up and taking apart a computer that still doesn't work (no motherboard and a MB killer CPU), and support calls.

With most games that are intensive, as soon as the CPU is needed, stuff just starts crashing. You literally have to throttle this CPU down to have system stability.

Present temp, writing this review, is 25 celsius. Surfing and watching videos on youtube, temps are around 29-35 celsius. Have not tried the Intel supplied cooler.Granted my gpu is not recent, I have yet to update my gtx 950, encoding video using cpu in handbrake is way faster  than when encoding using the gtx 950 nvenc and the resulting file size are quite smaller for the same visual quality.Encoding  pushes the  cpu and water cooling fans to 100%  and temps climb up to 99 degrees but it all works flawless.Have yet to game with it, will do when I get a new gpu.","Oct, 2023",JP D,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13500-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BQ6CFDCX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_4?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star&pageNumber=4

It's nothing pretty but it does the job. It come with the standard pre-applied thermal paste that you would expect, making installation very easy. The fasteners are push-plug style, no screwing required.I ran this with just that cooler for 8+ hours in a stagnant air case under moderate loads and the temperature stayed at a safe level.","Sep, 2023",Kendon,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-13500-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/product-reviews/B0BQ6CFDCX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star&pageNumber=1

After wasting an entire month trying to troubleshoot and fix my faulty Intel i9 processor and them telling me I'm ""very important"" and would assist me in fixing the issue. Today they decided to say, ""Since you didn't purchase directly from Intel, we can longer help."" They never helped in the first place and knowing that I had made a purchase through Newegg they still ""attempted"" to help me. They came up with ""fixes"" I could try on my own, many of which cause my PC to crash. Intel is by far the worst computing company to go to for any kind of help. I pray this company gets bought out and ran by someone who knows what their doing or burnt to the ground.

I confidently wrote to intel thinking their stated 3 year waranty would have me in a new computer in a jiffy. It has now been 3 days of exchanging messages with Ionut, who at first told me they would not honour the warranty becasue i could not prove I bough the device from a official disrtibutor, then told me that Intel has no stock of this item so all they can offer me is a RCP of $422.17 I dont know what this figure is but in Israel, where I am the cheapest device I can find in stock from their ""official"" distributor is over $600. I pointed out that all i want is a replacement or a refund of the amount it would take me to get a replacement and not a RPC from a different country.... but so far it has fallen on deaf ears, I have escallaed to surpervison now and will update you on the progress here. thus far it has been appaling experience and one which i did not expect from a global company like Intel.","Sep, 2022",Mark Baranov,||Rated 1 out of 5 stars,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.intel.com?page=2

,Poor customer services,"I had password box previously with over 100 passwords saved. Intel Truekey was being developed and they sent emails over a number of months saying it was coming. They informed password box users to move over to true key before a particular date as password box was being discontinued. 
There were technical issues which they could not resolve in moving my account over. So they said the only way would be to delete the password box account (and write down all of my passwords before doing so) then creating a new Truekey account. So based on what they said I did this. 
I fully expected to be able to add the over 100 passwords back into intel truekey. How wrong was I. They allowed only 15 passwords and demand an annual fee of $19.99 to enable me to add more.
I was not paying an annual subscription with password box and since they are the ones who told me to move over to truekey I do not see why I should be paying to have what I had previously. I never told them to create the software.
I spoke to their support team via chat. I am not sure what planet they are on, the first one started blabbering on about a McAfee Internet security suite subscription which expired in 2012 (nothing to do with password box!) which baffled me. Then passed to someone else who could not grasp the fact my password box account had been deleted by them and he kept asking me to login to password box. 
I call their call centre and their attitude is they fully understand they told me to move over from password box to truekey and that is was their decision but said sorry it is inconvenient but you will need to pay. Very poor response and truekey is no better than password box. It actually looks identical, just using different colours!","Feb, 2016",Aaron Ray,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.intel.com?page=3
,Excellent costumer service and RMA (CPU 9900K),"Excellent costumer service and RMA procedure. My Intel 9900K didn't work anymore. After trying different hardware parts and even bios updates I did change the CPU and found out the 9900k wasn't working properly. I did contact Intel and on their return page it was easy to explain the problem. Afterwards I emailed with Intel to explain it further. After some pictures, receipt and of course the processor numbers the CPU could be send towards Intel. This was done via a pick-up at my house with DHL. Sadly enough DHL didn't come on the pick-up day and Intel scheduled a new appointment. My wife called to DHL and even fixed a day earlier with the pickup. After some time the CPU arrived and it was checked. Sadly enough was the CPU indeed not working and a replacement or refund was offered. I did prefer to have a replacement. But this could take a long time since the 9900k was not in stock. In that case I did settle for a refund. This took around a week before the refund arrived. Great service! In total it did take more than a month. This took longer than expected. But as a customer for over a decade, going back to the Pentium 4 era, this was my only RMA in all those years.

,"Intel is controling customers and no one likes to be controlled, isn't it?","Intel provide CPUs from 55$ to 550$. A wide variety of choices which should be good from a far look, but at a closer look that is very annoying failure marketing plan fooling the customers by selling the same CPU with different prices and no one likes to be fooled, isn't it? let me explain:All these options actually comes from just 4 different CPUs:The lowest end 2/4 cores/threads PentiumThe low end 4/8 cores/threads I3The midrange 6/12 cores/threads I5The high end 8/16 cores/threads I7 or I9 (the I9 is completely a rip off...)Intel takes the same CPU for example the I3 and clock it differently higher and lower and lock it's multiplier then put a different price on each one of them from 100 to 150 bucks while all these are the same CPU sharing the same production cost. Intel enables OC on more pricy unlocked K ones with only expensive high end Z590 for several reasons. First the lower end models like I3 may outperform the higher end models in certain applications because it have less core count so better ability to overclock and get higher single core speed. Second Intel wants to charge overclockers a premium price of a Z590 moboIf Intel just do like AMD being a customer friendly, they will gain a lot more market share and become the common option again.Instead of having 2 different variant K unlocked and non k locked ones they should offer like AMD an X model with higher silicon quality and power usage and non X model with lower power usage while both of them are unlocked to overclock.Instead of making different prices they could average the price of only one model, unlock it and enable OC across all chipsets from low end motherboards to high end ones. That would help them to get a competitive price against AMD.Currently AMD Ryzen offer memory overclocking on every motherboard while you can't use high speed memory on Intel with low end motherboard and that is another mean marketing way by lowering the performance on the low end to force customers not to buy cheap motherboards.By the time every AMD Ryzen CPU is actually different than the other.Currently even on low end A520 AMD motherboard you can BCLK Overclock the CPU and the memory!You may think that lower end CPU silicones and lower end motherboards are not good at overclocking. You may be surprised if I told you there is almost no difference from achieved performance by BCLK OC on low end A520 motherboard + memory OC from the best MSI godlike high end X570 motherboard.I will not accept to be fooled by Intel selling me the same CPU with a different price. I will not accept Intel to control me by disabling high speed memory on the low end motherboards and force me to buy more expensive boards as I will not accept to be charged for Z590 motherboard just to be able to overclock and have fun with that as I won't accept to be a customer for a company that don't value my oppinion or my feedback.","Mar, 2021",Islam Ghunym,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.intel.com?page=3

"Intel Core i9-9900K Processor (3.60GHz, Octa-Core, LGA) - BX80684I99900K",Amazing processor,"I'm upgrading from a Q9550 and a AMD 965 BE and am continually impressed with the 9900K. Worth every penny as long as you aren't paying more than $510 for one. Definitely gonna need an AIO or beefy air cooler if you want to run over 4.3 Ghz's consistently. Pairs quite well with the Aorus Z390 Master motherboard. Two thumbs up. Don't let the jaded PC snoobs tell you otherwise, this processor is amazing. I'm using a Arctic Freezer II 280 AIO to cool at 5.0 solid clock. 32Gb 3600 CL 16 ram.

"Intel Core i9-9900K Processor (3.60GHz, Octa-Core, LGA) - BX80684I99900K",9900k beats threadripper as workstation IMO,"I was running a threadripper 2990wx in my workstation for after effects and c4d (and sometimes Houdini) thinking the 32-core beast would slay any tasks I threw at it. Not true! Viewport speeds in c4d were terribly slow... slower than my i5 from 2011... and ram previewing wasn’t much better. Apparently the lower (relatively) clock speed and less optimized architecture... possibly combined with issues in windows’ task scheduler... made threadripper a terrible workhorse for anything but rendering. Enter the 9900k. Less cores, but way faster clock and more streamlined architecture makes this thing way more responsive. I have never been able to interact with my computer faster. And the multitasking is insane. I was rendering with the cpu in c4d, while watching a YouTube video, while also working in after effects actively keyframing things and doing RAM previews all at the same time with no issues. Playback in AR was so smooth I actually forgot that I was still rendering. Maybe I got a lemon with my 2990wx, but the 9900k makes me very happy to be back on team blue. AMD is impressive on paper and in synthetic benchmarks but for me the proof was in the pudding.Read full review...","Dec, 2019",devenjamesl,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-Processor-3-60GHz-Octa-Core-LGA-BX80684I99900K/product-reviews/7025570418

If you're planning to overclock I recommend a custom loop water cooling solution, or so what I do and use an All-In-One Cooler, where everything is assembled for you and just install it. eVGA's CLC 280 is the one I use and it keeps my OC'd 9900K down around 35C.

I have put this cpu through the wringer and it exceeded my expectations.  Pros: Easy to install, fast, handles benchmarking with ease.Cons: The only con I could see is this cpu runs hot hot hot when pushed hard.  However, a good cooling system (I use a Be-Quiet fan) or a water-cooling solution will take care of the con.Value: This cpu is not cheap.  But, you get what you pay for.

If it didn’t cost $1200+ to get an alder lake i9, 64gb ddr5, and decent motherboard I would have gone 12th gen, but this offers similar performance to 10th and 11th gen i9s, and with a small OC I get just about equal to 5th gen ryzen 9.  For $3xx, if you can snag one, definitely not bad if you have 7th gen or less.  My friend has an 8400 and he gets roughly 10-15 fps less avg at 1440p, however my minimum frame rates are a lot higher.  No more stuttering, everything is just faster period, especially switching settings in games, I thought there was always a few seconds of stutter for switching settings in games but not with this cpu.

Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

"Intel Core i9-11900K Processor (5.3 GHz, 8 Cores, Socket FCLGA1200) Box  - BX8070811900K",This is a great CPU!,"Pros:- Overclocks very well as long as you’re willing to up the power limit appropriately- Very stable platform, which is the main reason why I purchased this CPU- It’s a perfect CPU for gaming and CAD when you need high IPCCons:- Very power hungry for 8-cores- Can run very hot when the power limit hits a certain threshold- A little pricey at the moment, but worth it depending on what you’re using it for- And of course, the big con which is that it’s a 14nm chipOther Thoughts:I’ll be honest, I am very impressed with this CPU.  I was very torn whether to go with the Ryzen 5900x, but for my line of work, I really needed a CPU with a high IPC, which this fits the bill.  I’ve got this overclocked to 5.1GHz on all cores, with it set to turbo boost to 5.3GHz on one core (two threads) and it performs way beyond my expectations.  To achieve this, I had to set the power limit to 280W, with the offset voltage maxing out at only 1.360V.  Temps reach about 85C max while rendering, using the Noctua NH-D15 CPU cooler.  This CPU would easily overclock higher, but 280W is all I’m willing to give it, and I wouldn’t be able to cool it with my air cooler.  I’ve paired this with the MSI MPG Z590 Gaming Carbon WiFi Gaming Motherboard & Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4 3600 Memory.  My previous setup was an 8700k overclocked to 4.9GHz, but was starting to show its age while doing CAD work, so I upgraded.  No joke, while rendering a 4K image at maximum quality using Solidworks Photoview 360 with three test images, it completes each rendering in almost exactly half the time!  I am so impressed!  Also, all my programs are so much snappier, especially Solidworks.  I didn’t expect this much of a performance boost from my 8700k.  I highly recommend this CPU!Read full review...","Jun, 2021",bradkman,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i9-11900K-Processor-5-3-GHz-8-Cores-Socket-FCLGA1200-Box-BX8070811900K/product-reviews/4045313122

By far, this is the best investment i have made for my laptop in conjunction with Arctic Silver 5 to keep it cool and help it last me a long time.If, like me, you're a laptop power-user or gamer by heart and you lack the monetary power to invest in those Sager's or Alienware's out there, let me tell you, putting this baby inside your laptop is the next best thing you can do.

However if you look at bang for the buck, these are all used now with some being sold as untested.  This is a joke.  Untested is worth a $25 gamble.  Otherwise for the pricepoint we are talking you can walk into a retail and buy a BRAND NEW i5-94xx series for this same exact price or for that matter a Ryzen 5 which would crush this thing in a second.  Bottom line - if you are simply looking for upgrading an existing, it's your only option (so thats both good and bad)  Better be sure what you buy is working and thus spending upwards of $200 in late 2019 for this processor becomes wasteful.","Dec, 2019",greenluminapackers,3 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-3-40-GHz-4-Cores-LGA-1151-SR2L2/product-reviews/12026967496?pgn=2

Intel Core i7 2860QM 2.5GHz Quad-Core (FF8062701065100) Processor,Second Gen Core i7 2860QM - the ultimate upgrade?,"I've been keeping an eye out for one of these for a long time- as an upgrade for a Lenovo z570 (its for my little wifey- she wants to play 'No Mans Sky' and her laptop is getting a bit long in the tooth). My reason for holding out as long as I did- was price- I had a target price in my head Eur 90 / US$100 that I didn't want to breach. This pulled chip (pre-used, taken from a working a laptop)- fit the bill on a price basis. Shipping was fast- and after a little bit of a clean up (demineralised water)- I was good to go.Before installing the processor- at the risk of stating the obvious- remove the battery and the powersupply.All-in-all- it took around 8 minutes to remove the bottom plate from the laptop, locate the screws holding the heatsink in situ (several- this laptop has onboard nVidia graphics on the same heatsink chain)- and unmount the pre-existing processor (there is a locking mechanism that has to be unscrewed and it lifts straight out- no force whatsoever needed). Putting a little thermal grease (a pea sized amount), I used Arctic silver- on the core before securing the locking mechanism again, putting the heatsink and fan back on- and screwing the whole lot back together again.The boost in power was immediately apparent- esp. in programmes which were optimised for multi threading (some video coding programmes for example)- the increase in L3 cache being as important here- as the extra cores.The one downside to this upgrade- is the unusual amount of heat the system generates- to say it gets hot is an understatement- you could possibly cook with it.........Processor performance may be reduced by thermal throttling- aka- if the heat system (heat sink fans etc) is not up to removing the additional heat- the system may throttle down the performance of the chip to keep it within certain temperature ranges to avoid damaging the chip itself or other laptop components.It really depends on your laptop- and how easy it is to access the case, fans, heatsink and processor socket- but in general its reasonably easy.If you can this processor at a reasonable price- as an upgrade its a bit of a no-brainer.A fast SSD is my next purchase.Read full review...","Jun, 2016",smccarrick,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i7-2860QM-2-5GHz-Quad-Core-FF8062701065100-Processor/product-reviews/111226602

My I5 system at the office takes about 40 seconds. I think it's an I5-4460.This CPU, in a Gigabyte GA-P67a-UD3 mobo takes 21 seconds from the moment I double-click on the file until the last of the many icons loads. Granted, I'm using a 2GB video card with this board, but I used the exact same card (nVidia) with the LGA775 system and it didn't decrease the load time significantly.Also, when I go to street view and move around, the video with this CPU is liquid smooth.

I personally upgraded from 2500k to the 2600k and I can definitely notice a difference in games where I had lower frames. Far Cry 4 and primal went from being able to play high setting to max setting on 1080p with a gtx 1060 6gb. I also noticed some gains in Planet coaster which was the real reason I wanted to upgrade (very cpu heavy game). I kept my expectations low, not everything got a huge boost in performance but for the most part almost all my games got just a little bit more smoother which was noticeable. If I hadn't seen any gains in the games I wanted after upgrading, I was going to head on the path of a new 6700k but I can honestly say that this little upgrade will probably be enough for me for the next few years.

I then temporary replaced my processor with this purchased one and ran the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool 64bit on the CPU.  It passed all test so then I put my original processor back in,  Since I do not need this replacement processor, I will relist it on ebay.

Intel Core i7-950 3.06GHz Quad-Core (BX80601950) Processor,The Intel Core i7 950 in ASUS WS Revolution w/12G Ram,"This is a solid processor.I loaded it into a ASUS P6T6 Work Station Revolution mobo w/12 gigs (6X2G) of corsair DDR3, a 1000W Cooler master PSU, and 6 320G WD Blacks in RAID5. I have an outdated 200 series GPU, but not for long. It booted up and runs great. The ASUS board hasn't missed a beat. You gotta pay attention to the RAID controller, on the way in.  Ctrl-M for Marvel & Ctrl-I for Intel.Anyways the core is running in a Coolermaster CM690 Advanced case with 6 X 140mm and 2 X 120mm fans. I have never had a set up this nice. I was worried about the ""mid tower"", but it's more like a full tower case.. I was also worried about fan noise, but you'd be amazed at how silent 6 140s run...In stock mode (3.06G to 3.33G) the CPU isn't even hitting 100F with the stock cooler, from Intel! It's sitting at 32C-36C in all 4 cores after a day of running. I am letting it all burn in for anouther 24 hours before I really run it hard.I'm impressed. I like seeing the 8 threads of 3+GHz and you toss the 6 drives in raid at it and I have the speed of an SSD with out the limited writes/reads for the same cost.I am mouting the CPU under the stairs, between my living room and my office. HDMI will run further than the 20' I need to have my TV set up as a primary or secondary monitor. Then, I'll run two or three 23"" in the office for WORK and a couple games... :) a Powered USB hub w/extension and a USB DVD drive for those little occations, will keep me from having to go into the closet.Windows Media Center, on this thing, ROCKS... It's a whole new lease on life for Media Center. I'll be able to feed BlueRay and 3D movies to my TV and run the glasses, with my existing TV!All in all, the combo of a i7 950, the ASUS P6T6, Coolermaster, Corsair, and WD RAID5 is going to satisfy my needs for years to come!!! I'll GROW my raid with 2TB drives and use the 320's as backup drives for my kids towers.I have had a DUAL Core 2.6G in almost the same config.... This setup makes that look like childs play.Good luck to you! BUY the parts! Built it! For the money, I would have spent $5,000-$7,000 for a prebuilt system.. This thing practically built it self.. Plug and play.. Windows7.. Instructions written on everything for idiots... My kid could have put this together and I have less than 1600.00 into it and less than a day putting it together!Read full review...","Mar, 2011",m$langevin,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i7-950-3-06GHz-Quad-Core-BX80601950-Processor/product-reviews/74095503

I have also done some multitasking, like playing Rift, surfing the internet, and playing itunes all at the same time and this processor hasn't been above a 20% load.  I've even been running animated desktop backgrounds and they run very smoothly.  The only bad part about the processor was the factory heat sink and fan because it's not the best cooling for the processor, and I kind of wish I didn't have to pay for that part of the package.","Feb, 2011",gtoracer400,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i7-950-3-06GHz-Quad-Core-BX80601950-Processor/product-reviews/74095503

At full load none of my 5 temp sensors EVER register more than 90 degrees farenheit.

Still, though, for a laptop which is docked and/or powered most of the time, this is a no-brainer upgrade, especially when you can get it for $69 like I did. Check out PassMark CPU benchmarks to see how fast this chip is; its single-threaded performance is very similar to that of my brand new MacBook Pro's i7 chip! Not only that, but it's quad-core too.

Use a reasonable amount of good thermal compound and this 47W TDP will run the same temp as the 37W you replace since Dell used way too much on both the CPU and NVIDIA GPU.","Mar, 2017",ks9969,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Intel-Core-i7-4810MQ-2-8-GHz-Quad-Core-SR1PV-Processor/product-reviews/21025340309

And thats good for editing video. Sometimes my laptop would crash for being too hot and it wasted a lot of time, but now with the 4810MQ it doesnt do that.

If U want old Mobo and CPU  + 16 GB RAM, case and power supply from selling on eBay these sell for $139 + $15 ship just he Mobo and attached CPU, so this worth to clear $120 or so after shipping, if interested contact me. If this not allowed on here I'm sorry. Just coming up for air with this after a half a day. This is a major upgrade for me. I don't game. So i don't  need an expensive video card.

Haven't overclocked yet, so I can't comment on that.If you're using an older chipset that only supports the Ivy Bridge processors with a BIOS upgrade, make sure you do the upgrade before you install the 3570k. I wasted a lot of time trouble shooting compatibility, and had to put in an older processor to upgrade the BIOS on a GA-Z68X-UD3P. Learn from my mistakes!In my opinion this CPU is the best value right now. i7s are not worth the upgrade except in very unlikely situations where you would usually buy Enterprise hardware anyway. The 3000 series is a better value than the second generation of Ivy Bridge, which didn't offer any architectural improvements, but any of the K series i5s is a good choice.

Intel Core i3-2100 3.1GHz Dual-Core (BX80623I32100) Processor,Most overlooked and undervalued CPU around,"Honestly I think Intel is laughing their butts off because this ""little"" CPU keeps up with low level i7's. I consistently benchmark as high as i5's and i7's and I do not even have a separate GPU. People like to think, especially in the computer world, that you have so spend thousands of dollars to get a good system. That is not true. I spent less than $500 and have a computer that kicks butt. When my friends use my computer they always comment how fast it is and automatically assume I have an i7 or i5. But no, its an i3 2100 with 8GB RAM. Thats it.This CPU is a dual core but it has hyper threading which makes it function 'similar' to a quad core. Not the same but close. Also, it is 3.1 Ghz. I have not met a game that I couldnt play (remember I do not have a GPU, I am using the graphics processor inside the i3)...Yes some games might not perform the best or they play choppy but its an i3 that cost less than $100. If you paired this with some decent RAM and a good GPU, you could perform miracles.Read full review...","Nov, 2015",blazeaglory714,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i3-2100-3-1GHz-Dual-Core-BX80623I32100-Processor/product-reviews/109634318

The i3 comes ready to install with a heat sink / fan and thermal pate inclued. The CPU has 4 threads/ path for information to flow making it extremely fast, good enough for gaming some.

The pricing is about right and you can also get an i5 0r i7 for added benefits for demanding software.","Apr, 2020",pt_crusier_2002,5 out of 5 stars,https://www.ebay.com/urw/Intel-Core-i3-8100-3-60-GHz-Quad-Core-BX80684I38100-Processor/product-reviews/16022897864
